Daniel Brouwer (MSc)

He finished MSc project about the vertical axis rotation in the Central Iberian Orocline. We did a week of sampling in limestones in central Spain. He had the amazing opportunity of visiting Toledo, Trujillo, Salamanca and Segovia during the fieldwork. He managed to do the worst core I have ever seen. I have to say that he improved quickly after that and did pretty good ones too. He is also the only person that enters with a big smile to the cryo shifts...
