abstract = "Dynamic content features, such as animations, videos or 3D representations are useful tools to explain dynamic geological processes. Modern technologies permit development of animations that are more illustrative and instructive than the classic static figures traditionally used in scientific papers. In addition, the use of supplemental files in traditional journals, and especially within new electronic journals, permit inclusion of interactive content as an analogue to the dynamic nature of geological processes. We present a collection of dynamic animations based on previous data. These animations are used to deliver ideas about the kinematic and mechanical development of the Ibero-Armorican orocline and to illustrate the complex evolution and timing of orocline formation, its tectonic setting on a regional and global-scale, and its implications for the modification of the lithosphere during orogeny."
