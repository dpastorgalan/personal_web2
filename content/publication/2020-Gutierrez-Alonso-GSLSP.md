# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The Cantabrian Zone, in the Variscan belt of Western Europe, has one of the most continuous Ediacaran-Palaeozoic stratigraphic successions in the world. This succession has been previously extensively studied, including several detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological studies on with detrital zircon geochronology with 30 available samples spanning the aforementioned time extentslice. In this work, we present data from three new samples covering previously unsampled time-slices and perform multidimensional analysis in on the 33 samples in order to quantify the similarity/dissimilarity among all of them with the aim of detecting potential changes in source areas along through time and the role of recycling. The results indicate a continuous source of sediments from Ediacaran to late Devonian times punctuated by a sudden ephemeral change in the Early Cambrian that can be attributed to local causes during the inception of the Palaeozoic passive margin."
